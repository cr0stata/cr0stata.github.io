# Research
Listed below are my research interests, which include both my main work but also my free time. 
  

### [Aerospace]()  🚀  
[comment]: <> ../research/aerospace  
My main field of research, focused in propulsion, optimization methods, numerical analysis and machine learning.

### [Poincaré Podcast and NFT collection](../research/poincare) 🔭 
Poincaré Trajectories was a interdisciplinary research <code>sandbox</code> about dynamical systems theory and related topics.  
The interplay of the ideas of two aerospace engineers, a computer scientist and a musician resulted in a digital art collection describing the synergies between music, art and mathematics.

### [Testing](../research/testing) 🧑🏻‍💻
Here you find my side projects.
