Listed below are my research interests, which include both my main work but also my free time. 
  

### [Aerospace](../research/aerospace)  🚀
My main field of research, focused in propulsion, system optimization, numerical analysis and machine learning.

### NFT collection and Poincaré Podcast 🔭 
Poincaré Trajectories was a interdisciplinary research <code>sandbox</code> about dynamical systems theory and related topics.  
The interplay of the ideas of two aerospace engineers, a computer scientist and a musician resulted in an NFT collection that describes the synergies between music, art and mathematics.

### Testing 🧑🏻‍💻
