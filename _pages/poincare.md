Founded by [Matteo Manzi](https://github.com/matteoettam09), Poincar√© Trajectories aimed to develop software to solve problems at the level of methodological frameworks for both aerospace engineering and quantitative finance and was quickly acquired by [CrunchDAO](https://www.crunchdao.com).  

Here, I was involved as a manager in the [Poincar√© Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/5sEto8EKtIeEC4QkgBYmPi?si=8876c3938c1d40eb) and as a developer for a [Julia library](https://github.com/matteoettam09/FTLE.jl) in the context of coherent structures. Currently, for work reasons, the projects are on standby. 

## Poincar√© Podcast üéô
Inevitably inspired by greats like Lex Fridman, [Poincar√© Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/5sEto8EKtIeEC4QkgBYmPi?si=8876c3938c1d40eb), which began with the idea of expanding authors' knowledge with a learn-in-public approach, was an interview-based show around topics such as machine learning, dynamical systems and data analysis.  [Here](../poincare/pp_list) you can find a list of the (amazing) guests.
