Hi! 👋🏼 🚀

Here I will put a list of thoughts with an undefined order.

02/03/2022
Main features of the site are end. 
After some effort to reverse-engineer the @mmistakes layout, here we are. 
Currently, only minor updates and site fills are needed.  
Returning to the main work, data elaboration in ongoing. The overlap of pressure readings is stucking me.
But I'm sure I'll fix. At the end of this task, the main features of the paper should emerge. 
I hope to allign this with Alvaro, a nice spanish guy I'm following for the thesis.
