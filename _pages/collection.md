# Overview

The Poincaré Trajectories Digital Art Collection is an interdisciplinary research focusing on the theoretic implications of dynamical systems theory, complex systems theory in music composition, and on the synergy between visual art, music and science. 

This NFT collection that marries applied math, blockchain and music into a single, captivating experience. Each NFT in this collection encapsulates the essence of chaos through mathematical models, accompanied by compositions resonating with the underlying frequencies. 

## Impact

The mathematical underpinnings add an intellectual layer to the experience.  
Collectors are drawn to the uniqueness of each NFT, as no two are alike.

Bifurcation theory is the mathematical study of changes in the qualitative or topological structure of a given family of curves, such as the integral curves of a family of vector fields, and the solutions of a family of differential equations. Most commonly applied to the mathematical study of dynamical systems, a bifurcation occurs when a small smooth change made to the parameter values (the bifurcation parameters) of a system causes a sudden 'qualitative' or topological change in its behavior. Bifurcations occur in both continuous systems (described by ordinary, delay or partial differential equations) and discrete systems (described by maps).

The name "bifurcation" was first introduced by Henri Poincare' in 1885 in the first paper in mathematics showing such a behavior.

The music inspiration is given by the sudden change of one frame to another, which creates an "explosion" effect to the track.

## 023

Audio: granular synthesis that emulates movement.

## 024, 025, 026, 027

Perturbed pendulum. Integrable systems may be seen as very different in qualitative character from more generic dynamical systems, which are more typically chaotic systems. The distinction between integrable and nonintegrable dynamical systems has the qualitative implication of regular motion vs. chaotic motion and hence is an intrinsic property, not just a matter of whether a system can be explicitly integrated into an exact form. Audio: granular synthesis which follows the animation.

## 028

Perturbed pendulum. In mathematics and physics, the Poincaré recurrence theorem states that certain dynamical systems will, after a sufficiently long but finite time, return to a state arbitrarily close to (for continuous state systems), or exactly the same as (for discrete state systems), their initial state. Audio: granular synthesis which follows the animation.

## 029, 030, 031

Audio made with custom presets of Moog sub 37 and Access T Virus. Each preset has various random parameters on the modulation generators (LFOs, envelopes etc), and the music tries to follow the "fall into the void" effect given by the animation.

## 035

Standard map, zoom-out. In mathematics, an iterated function is a function from X to X (that is, a function from some set X to itself) which is obtained by composing another function f : X to X with itself a certain number of times. The process of repeatedly applying the same function is called iteration. In this process, starting from some initial object, the result of applying a given function is fed again in the function as input, and this process is repeated. Music: simple oscillators that grow like a "swarm" as the zoom of the plot decreases.

The Log Periodic Power Law Singularity model provides a flexible framework to detect bubbles and predict regime changes of a financial asset. A bubble is defined as a faster-than-exponential increase in asset price, that reflects positive feedback loop of higher return anticipations competing with negative feedback spirals of crash expectations. It models a bubble price as a power law with a finite-time singularity decorated by oscillations with a frequency increasing with time. Audio generated by the plot information, transformed into MIDI notes and sent to synths.

## 060

Stochastic Celestial Mechanics.

Determinism is an idealization: real dynamical systems cannot be isolated from their environments and thus always experience stochastic influence. This work focuses on the implications of this in celestial mechanics. Inspired by the recently introduced Stochastic Two-Body problem, we here introduce the Stochastic Three-Body problem, in which the motion of the point mass is both influenced by the gravitational attraction of the primaries and by a stochastic perturbation, arising from random fluctuations of mass distributions in the solar system. Restricting our analysis on the planar, circular case, after deriving the equations of motion, we discuss the effect of the stochastic perturbation on the symplectic structure of the original dynamical system, and the relations with deterministic nearly-integrable dynamical systems in general. We show the implications of the stochastic perturbation, particularly via Ito’s lemma, for diffusion processes and the existence of weak first integrals. Audio: through a generative system built with Max MSP and Mira for Ipad that modify the frequency and the amplitude of a sound according to the position of a finger in the x y, the resulting spectrum of x(t) has tracked and "redrawn" as is does with a drawing with tracing paper. By repeating the process several times, and merging the takes, the result is a single spectrum obtained in a semi-random way.

## 067

A Levy flight is a random walk in which the step-lengths have a stable distribution, a probability distribution that is heavy-tailed. When defined as a walk in a space of dimension greater than one, the steps made are in isotropic random directions. The use of the term has extended to also include cases where the random walk takes place on a discrete grid rather than on a continuous space. Audio: the entire x y z values have been exported, placed in text files and read at animation speed. Each values of the three dimensions over time has applied to various synthesis and sampler parameters, such as note, MIDI control changes, and effects, following the movement of the Levy Flight.
