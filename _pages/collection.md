**Overview**  

Poincar√© digital art collection is a NFT collection that marries applied math, blockchain and music into a single, captivating experience. Each NFT in this collection encapsulates the essence of chaos through mathematical models, accompanied by compositions resonating with the underlying frequencies. 

**Impact**  

The mathematical underpinnings add an intellectual layer to the experience.  
Collectors are drawn to the uniqueness of each NFT, as no two are alike.

**Future Directions**  

Continuing to expand the collection with new mathematical concepts, together with the exploration of opportunities for real-world exhibitions to bridge the gap.
