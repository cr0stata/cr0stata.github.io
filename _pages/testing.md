My public side projects.

### [OpenCV + HTML](../testing/opencv)
Here you can find how to include and start to use <code>opencv.js</code> in HTML pages.

### [Backlog Links](../testing/links)
A useless list of links. Inspired by Mr. Rip.

### [Three.js + HTML](../testing/three)
<code>Three.js</code> integration in HTML. To use later to list my 3D stuff (Euclid, Falcon, CADO).
