# [Cavitation-Induced Flow Instabilities Identification](https://cr0stata.github.io/blog/how-to-remove-excerpt-from-archive-item.md/)
[Cavitation-Induced Flow Instabilities Identification](https://cr0stata.github.io/blog/how-to-remove-excerpt-from-archive-item.md/)
The main work I'm focusing on. Using bayesian identifcations and MLE in cavitating inducers for rocket engines.

# [Stochastic Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponentss]()
The second main task. Using the chaos theory to perform uncertainty propagation in dynamical systems.

# [Pre-Phase A - Microsatellites Constellation for Global Ship Monitoring]()
An amazing past project. An ESA-like university <em>concurrent engineering</em> project focused in a constellation for global ship monitoring.

# [Euclid: Payload and Service Module Structural Analysis]()
Another amazing past project.
