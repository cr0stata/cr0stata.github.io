## [Cavitation-Induced Flow Instabilities Identification](https://cr0stata.github.io/work1/)
The main work I'm focusing on.  
Using bayesian identifcations and MLE in cavitating flows in inducers for rocket engines.

## [Stochastic Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponents](https://cr0stata.github.io/work2/)
The second main task.  
Using the chaos theory to perform uncertainty propagation in dynamical systems.

## [Pre-Phase A - Microsatellites Constellation for Global Ship Monitoring](https://cr0stata.github.io/nemo/)
An amazing past project.  
An ESA-like university <em>concurrent engineering</em> project focused in a constellation for global ship monitoring.

## [Euclid: Payload and Service Module Structural Analysis](https://cr0stata.github.io/euclid/)
Another amazing past project.
