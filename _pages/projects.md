## [Cavitation-Induced Flow Instabilities Identification](https://cr0stata.github.io/work1/)
The main work I'm focusing on. Using bayesian identifcations and MLE in cavitating flows in inducers for rocket engines.

## [Stochastic Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponents]()
The second main task. Using the chaos theory to perform uncertainty propagation in dynamical systems.

## [Pre-Phase A - Microsatellites Constellation for Global Ship Monitoring]()
An amazing past project. An ESA-like university <em>concurrent engineering</em> project focused in a constellation for global ship monitoring.

## [Euclid: Payload and Service Module Structural Analysis]()
Another amazing past project.
