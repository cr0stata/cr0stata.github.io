#### [Flow Instabilities in Rocket Engine Inducers]()
The main work I'm focusing on.  
Using bayesian identifcations and MLE to catch the main characteristics of the unsteady flows inside inducers for rocket engines.

#### [Uncertanty Quantification in Dynamical Systems]()
Developed Julia code to extract chaos indicators (e.g. FTLE) from some of the most popular [chaotic maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chaotic_maps). 

#### [Microsatellites constellation for Global Ship Monitoring (Phase 0)]()
A <em> concurrent engineering </em> university project (ESA-like) focused on a satellite constellation for global ship monitoring.

#### [Euclid: Payload and Service Module Structural Analysis]()
Structural and mechanical study of [Euclid](https://www.euclid-ec.org), an ESA medium class astronomy and astrophysics space mission, aimed to understand why the expansion of the Universe is accelerating.
