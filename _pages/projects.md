### [Flow instabilities in rocket engine inducers](https://cr0stata.github.io/work1/)
The main work I'm focusing on.  
Using bayesian identifcations and MLE to catch the main characteristics of the unsteady flows inside inducers for rocket engines.

### [Uncertanty quantification in dynamical systems](https://cr0stata.github.io/work2/)
Developed Julia code to extract chaos indicators (e.g. FTLE) from some of the most popular [chaotic maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chaotic_maps). 

### [Microsatellites Constellation for Global Ship Monitoring (Phase 0)](https://cr0stata.github.io/nemo/)
An ESA-like university <em>concurrent engineering</em> project focused in a constellation for global ship monitoring.

### [Euclid: Payload and Service Module Structural Analysis](https://cr0stata.github.io/euclid/)
Structural and mechanical study of [Euclid](https://www.euclid-ec.org), an ESA medium class astronomy and astrophysics space mission, aimed to understand why the expansion of the Universe is accelerating.
